They were ordered in compiler speed. Pascal, C, C++ and C++11 runs in 0.000 s for these problems. Python3, Pascal and Java have
bounds checking of arrays. C and C++ can have bounds checking if you use [ROOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROOT).

In my case C++ and C++11 use the same file.

I only solve rather simple problems here and no assignments.
